WSGIProxy2 gives tools to proxy arbitrary(ish) WSGI requests to
other processes over HTTP. It is a fork of the inactive WSGIProxy.

It will encode the WSGI request CGI-style environmental variables
(which must be strings), plus a configurable set of other variables.
It also sends values like HTTP_HOST and wsgi.url_scheme which are
often obscured by the proxying process, as well as values like
SCRIPT_NAME. On the receiving end, WSGI middleware fixes up the
environment to represent the state of the original request. This
makes HTTP more like FastCGI or SCGI, which naturally preserve these
values.
