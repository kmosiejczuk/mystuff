Open-Dyslexic is a new open source font created to increase readability
for readers with dyslexia. The typeface includes regular, bold, italic,
and bold-italic styles. It is being updated continually and improved
based on input from other dyslexic users.

Open-Dyslexic Mono is included for programming, or other areas where a
fixed width font is preferred.
