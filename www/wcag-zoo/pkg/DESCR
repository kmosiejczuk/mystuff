WCAG-Zoo is a set of command line tools that help provide basic
validation of HTML against the accessibility guidelines laid out
by the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.

Each tool checks against a limited set of these and is designed to
return simple text output and returns an error (or success) code
so it can be integrated into continuous build tools like Travis-CI
or Jenkins. It can even be imported into your Python code for
additional functionality.
