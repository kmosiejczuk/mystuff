importlib_resources is a backport of Python 3.7's standard library
importlib.resources module for Python 2.7, and 3.4 through 3.6.
Users of Python 3.7 and beyond should use the standard library
module, since for these versions, importlib_resources just delegates
to that module.

The key goal of this module is to replace parts of pkg_resources
with a solution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs.
This makes reading resources included in packages easier, with more
stable and consistent semantics.
