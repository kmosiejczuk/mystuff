Manhole is an in-process service that will accept unix domain socket
connections and present the stacktraces for all threads and an
interactive prompt. It can either work as a python daemon thread
waiting for connections at all times or a signal handler (stopping
your application and waiting for a connection).

Access to the socket is restricted to the application's effective
user id or root.

This is just like Twisted's manhole. It's simpler (no dependencies),
it only runs on Unix domain sockets (in contrast to Twisted's manhole
which can run on telnet or ssh) and it integrates well with various
types of applications.
