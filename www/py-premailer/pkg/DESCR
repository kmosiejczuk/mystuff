premailer parses an HTML page, looks up style blocks and parses the
CSS. It then uses the lxml.html parser to modify the DOM tree of
the page accordingly.

It can also turn relative URLs into absolute files, ignore processing
certain style or link tags and create additional HTML attributes
from basic attributes contained within the CSS.
